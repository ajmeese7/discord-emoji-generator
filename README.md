# discord-emoji-generator
Generates emojis with a specified font for use on Discord.

## TODO
- Add option to create [animated emojis](https://github.com/DenverCoder1/readme-typing-svg)
- Add hosting on GitHub pages

## Ideas
- Export each character in a sentence as a different emoji, adding names to an array as
an indicator that a letter doesn't need to be generated again, then download the lot of them
as a ZIP file.
	- Intended for use with custom fonts, to port them to Discord. Need to have different options
	for upper case and lower case as well.
	- Checkbox option to generate the whole alphabet, that way they can use as desired
